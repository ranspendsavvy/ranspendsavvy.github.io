**Privacy Policy — Nostalgia Alarm**

**Last updated:** January 16, 2026

Nostalgia Alarm (“the App”) lets you wake up to photos from your device’s gallery. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

**1. Data We Access**
- **Photos/Media (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES / READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)**: Read-only access to your photos to select and display images in the alarm screen. No photos are uploaded or stored on our servers.
- **Notifications & Alarms (POST_NOTIFICATIONS, SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM, USE_EXACT_ALARM, FOREGROUND_SERVICE, USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT, WAKE_LOCK, VIBRATE)**: Used to schedule and show alarms, heads-up notifications, vibration, and the full-screen alarm UI.
- **Boot receiver (RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED)**: Reschedules alarms after a device restart so alarms remain reliable.
- **Optional Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO)**: Used only when you choose to record a quick alarm.
- **Battery optimization exemption (REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS)**: Requested so alarms remain reliable; you can deny or revoke this.

**2. Data We Do Not Collect**
- We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data, identifiers, or location.
- No analytics, ads, or third-party tracking SDKs are used.

**3. Data Storage**
- All app data (alarms, settings, optional sounds) is stored locally on your device. Removing the app deletes this data.

**4. Data Sharing**
- We do not share data with third parties. Photos and recordings never leave your device.

**5. Security**
- Local data is stored using the operating system’s standard app storage. No server-side processing occurs.

**6. Your Choices**
- You can revoke permissions at any time in system settings. The app will still run with reduced functionality (e.g., no photos without media permission; no recording without microphone permission).
- Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data created by the App.

**7. Children’s Privacy**
- The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

**8. Changes to This Policy**
- If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date and publish the new policy. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
